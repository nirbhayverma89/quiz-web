        "options": ["0.100", "0.115", "0.125", "0.150"],
        "correct_index": 2,
        "explanation": "Approximating (50.2×0.49)/199.8 as 50×0.5/200 gives 25/200 = 0.125."

        "question": "How many prime numbers between 1 and 100 are factors of 7150?",
        "options": ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
        "correct_index": 2,
        "explanation": "7150 = 2 × 5² × 11 × 13, so there are 4 distinct prime numbers."

        "question": "Among a group of 2500 people, 35% invest in municipal bonds, 18% invest in oil stocks, and 7% invest in both. What is the probability that a randomly selected person invests in municipal bonds but not in oil stocks?",
        "options": ["18%", "25%", "28%", "35%"],
        "correct_index": 2,
        "explanation": "Only municipal bonds = 35% - 7% = 28%."

        "question": "A swim club has 60 members, of which 30% passed a lifesaving test. Among those who didn’t, 12 took a preparatory course and 30 did not. How many total members are in the club?",
        "options": ["50", "55", "60", "65"],
        "correct_index": 2,
        "explanation": "Since 42 members failed (12 + 30) and that represents 70% of total members, total = 42×100/70 = 60."
      },
      {

        "correct_index": 2,
        "explanation": "White appears at positions 3, 8, 13, …; solving the arithmetic progression yields 68."

        "question": "There are two boxes: one with 39 red balls and the other with 26 green balls. You can move balls to maximize the probability of picking a red ball. What is the maximum probability?",
        "options": ["0.75", "0.8", "0.85", "0.9"],
        "correct_index": 1,
        "explanation": "Optimal strategy: Put 1 red ball in one box and the rest in the other, giving a probability of 0.8."

        "question": "In how many ways can 3 postcards be posted in 5 postboxes?",
        "options": ["60", "100", "125", "150"],
        "correct_index": 2,
        "explanation": "Each postcard has 5 choices, so total ways = 5³ = 125."

        "question": "A is twice as efficient as B. A and B together complete a work in 7 days. In how many days can A alone complete the work?",
        "options": ["10", "10.5", "11", "12"],
        "correct_index": 1,
        "explanation": "Since A's efficiency is twice that of B, A alone completes the work in 10.5 days."

        "options": ["10", "20", "33", "40"],
        "correct_index": 2,
        "explanation": "Since 5! and above are divisible by 5!, only 1!+2!+3!+4! contribute: 1+2+6+24 = 33."
